# Vizathon 2021: The People vs Covid-19

### About
We are inspired by the medical workers and researchers that help us fight this pandemic everyday. Besides them, some great visualizations like [this one](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) showed us how insightful these visualizations can be. Like our inspirations, we created visualizations that will provide information in an appealing and digestible manner for the general public.

Our project features widgets, each of which provides a unique view of Covid-19 data. The first widget is a tracker that updates with recent data on the global number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. Below that, we have several visualizations which show different aspects of the data. These  include an interactive map and different charts to visualize the data.  Finally, we feature an interactive simulation which demonstrates how to "flatten the curve" through vaccinations and social distancing.
